# Squish

A game I used to play a lot when I was younger. It was included in a version of WordPerfect Office, or WordPerfect Works, or something like that.

I *think* the actual game was called **Beast**.

## About the Game

In **Squish**, you control a character navigating through a maze filled with creatures. Your goal is to push blocks strategically to trap and squish the enemies before they can catch you. It’s a mix of puzzle-solving and quick reflexes, inspired by the classic mechanics of the original game.

## Gameplay Features

- **Enemy Squishing**: Push rocks to crush enemies and clear the level.
- **Multiple Enemy Types**: Each with different behaviors and strategies to counter:
  - Regular enemies try to eat you
  - Eggs, that hatch into Pushers
  - Pushers, that can (and will) try to squish you. In addition, they can only be squished between a rock and a wall
- High scores!
- **Retro Visuals and Sounds**: True to the original game’s minimalist style. Ahem. 

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move your character in four directions.
- **<esc>**: Pause the game.
- **q**: Quit the game
