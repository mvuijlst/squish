# Contributing

**Found a bug?** 
Check if it’s already reported. If not, create an issue describing the problem with as much detail as possible.

**Submitting a Fix?** 
Open a pull request with a brief explanation of the problem and your fix. Keep it simple—no need for fancy words.

**Adding a Feature?** 
Feel free to suggest it via an issue, but expect skepticism. Squish is a nostalgia project, so changes need to feel right.

# General Guidelines

Be nice, keep it small, and remember: It’s just a game and I don't actually know what I'm doing.
